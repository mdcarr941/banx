Preview of rendered content while editing a tex file in a course:
  If the user is editing a .tex file on the course tab, when ever they
  click save (or press Ctrl-S) a preview of the content should be refreshed.
  This could be done using Xloud.

Integration with Ximera:
  When the user commits changes to a course, these should be visible
  to users who subsequently load the course.

X Better command line interface:
  The CLI is too terse with its output. There needs to be a more helpful
  message displayed (a usage summary perhaps) when it doesn't recognize its input.
